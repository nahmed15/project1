		  <p>I think this video not only describes how much i love to travel but also other things I like to do.</p>
		  <p> Travelling is not only to buy plane tickets but also road trips, long drives and much more.
		  I remember earlier this year, I travelled to Ohio from Chicago, I was so excited for my road trip and enjoyed every bit of it. 
		  Eventhough, I had to go to some other place in Chicago the next day but I did'nt wanted to miss this road trip too.
		  So yeah, I forgot everything and went like this moment won't come again in my life.
		  I got tired but it was worth it.</p>
